            <h2>Drip Coffee</h2>
            <p>Drip coffee is the most common method of brewing. It involves pouring hot water over ground coffee beans placed in a filter. The water seeps through the coffee, absorbing its flavors and oils, and drips into a carafe or pot.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a filter in the coffee maker.</li>
                <li>Add ground coffee to the filter (typically one tablespoon per cup).</li>
                <li>Pour water into the reservoir.</li>
                <li>Start the coffee maker and let the coffee brew.</li>
                <li>Once brewed, serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Espresso</h2>
            <p>Espresso is brewed by forcing hot water under pressure through finely ground coffee. It is known for its rich, intense flavor and is used as the base for many other coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill the espresso machineâ€™s portafilter with finely ground coffee.</li>
                <li>Tamp the coffee to ensure an even extraction.</li>
                <li>Lock the portafilter into the espresso machine.</li>
                <li>Start the machine and let the water pass through the grounds.</li>
                <li>Once brewed, enjoy your espresso as-is or use it for other coffee drinks.</li>

            <h2>French Press</h2>
            <p>French press is a simple brewing method that involves steeping ground coffee in hot water, then using a plunger to press the grounds down and filter the coffee.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add coarsely ground coffee to the French press (typically one tablespoon per cup).</li>
                <li>Pour hot water (just below boiling) over the grounds.</li>
                <li>Stir the coffee and water mixture.</li>
                <li>Place the lid on the press and let it steep for 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slowly press the plunger down to separate the grounds from the coffee.</li>
                <li>Pour and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
